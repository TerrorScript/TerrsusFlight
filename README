Air 3S Android SDK App
This project is an Android application built to communicate with the DJI Air 3S drone using the DJI Mobile SDK v5.The goal is to establish a reliable connection to the RC331 remote controller, display the live video feed, and eventually send basic flight commands.

The app includes:
- USB accessory detection for the RC331
- Permission handling for USB communication
- DJI SDK initialization after permission is granted
- A clean activity structure for future expansion
- A foundation for adding video decoding and control APIs

This project is a personal learning effort and a way to explore drone development while flying with my father.

Features (current state)
- Detects and connects to the RC331 controller
