Air 3S Android SDK App
This project is an Android application built to communicate with the DJI Air 3S drone using the DJI Mobile SDK v5.The goal is to establish a reliable connection to the RC331 remote controller, display the live video feed, and eventually send basic flight commands.

The app includes:
- USB accessory detection for the RC331
- Permission handling for USB communication
- DJI SDK initialization after permission is granted
- A clean activity structure for future expansion
- A foundation for adding video decoding and control APIs

This project is a personal learning effort and a way to explore drone development while flying with my father.

Features (current state)
- Detects and connects to the RC331 controller
- Initializes the DJI SDK correctly
- Loads the main activity after registration
- Ready for adding video feed and control logic

Planned
- Display the live camera feed
- Implement basic flight commands
- Improve UI and connection status handling

This is where DJI’s CLX module hooks in.
This is where your crash was happening earlier.

3. Application.onCreate()
DJI SDK initialization begins here.

4. Activity lifecycle starts
DJIAircraftMainActivity.onCreate()

onStart()

onResume()

5. ViewModels initialize
BaseMainActivityVm

MSDKInfoVm

MSDKManagerVM

6. DJI SDK background threads start
Registration

Product detection

USB monitoring

Link monitoring

7. USB broadcast receivers register
Your usbReceiver is here.

8. USB attach events fire
If a DJI controller is connected.
